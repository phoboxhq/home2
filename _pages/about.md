# What is phobox?
Phobox is a small tool to extend your local picture storage with a bunch of connectivity features. 
It starts a lightweight server process, which you allows to access your pictures over a graphical user interface
or a REST-API. Moreover you can organize your files and create collections of the best photographs.

**I developed phobox to solve three main problems in my picture workflow:**
 - organize new pictures from camera to the correct directories
 - get a simple and fast access to the pictures on my smartphone at home
 - search for pictures
