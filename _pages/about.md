## What is phobox?
Phobox is a small tool to extend your local picture storage with a bunch of connectivity features. 
It starts a lightweight server process, which you allows to access your pictures over a graphical user interface
or a REST-API. Moreover you can organize your files and create collections of the best photographs.

**I developed phobox to solve three main problems in my picture workflow:**
 - organize new pictures from camera to the correct directories
 - get a simple and fast access to the pictures on my smartphone at home
 - search for pictures

## What is different to other systems?
This application is niche product with a special use case. I concentrate to the following principles:
* Phobox have to work with existing directories of photos
* Phobox doesn't change the existing directory stucture of photos
* Phobox has no cloud services -> your files are saved on your harddrive
* Phobox provides a simple webinterface for accessing the photos on a webbrowser
* Phobox provides a REST API for advanced usage cases
* Phobox provides information of your photo storage

## Background
Phobox is born as a private project to be a lean solution to get a fast and easy access to my personal pictures at home on different devices. It should be a lightweight extention to an existing picture storage and can be used as simple picture organizer, too.

After a couple of years of development and personal usage I decided to make this project public. Phobox solves the origin problems in my daily photo workflow. I think out there are persons with the same problems, too. Maybe you?!
