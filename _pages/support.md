_Under construction_

### User support in case of problems
  * issue tracking system from github
  * wiki page or faq on website (maybe a collection?)

### Supporting the project Phobox
  * Why is support important?
    * starts as side project by one person, but should used by many
    * the development and maintenance for one person is very time consuming
    * many eyes see more
    * a certain interest in this project increases motivation
  * What can I do?
    * with hands
      * report bugs
      * report ideas or feature requests
      * translations (there are currently only English and German)
      * fix bugs and start pull requests
      * extend the FAQ/wiki for other users
      * recommend Phobox your friends
    * with money
      * use github sponsor
      * buy merchandise
