## Supporting the project Phobox

You really like the project and you want to give something back or being a part of it?
There are so many ways to help ... also without programming skills.

### Why is support important?
  * Phobox starts as side project by one person, but should used by many
  * the development and maintenance for one person is very time consuming
  * many eyes see more
  * a certain interest in this project increases motivation
  
### What can I do?
  * **with my hands**
    * report bugs
    * report ideas or feature requests
    * translations (there are currently only English and German)
    * fix bugs and start pull requests
    * extend the FAQ/wiki for other users
    * recommend Phobox your friends
  * **with my money**
    * use github sponsor
    * buy merchandise
