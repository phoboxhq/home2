Currently phobox is a private project in my github repo. But I decide to open it to everyone and make it a fully open source software project. That's why I built this website. Also open source and with githubs static page generator jekyll.  

Well, but why publish the site first and than the programm? It's quite simple. I don't think anyone downloads a tool without knowing anything about it :-)
